[A petition at change.org](https://www.change.org/petitions/reddit-inc-accept-dogecoin-as-a-currency-on-reddit) may push Dogecoin into the mainstream. Dogecoin has been on a rollercoaster ride, just reaching its [first month anniversary](http://imgur.com/CSzvIFR) since its creation. Currently trading near 25 Satoshi/DOGE (0.00000025 BTC/DOGE), Dogecoin is attempting to make an appeal at larger markets with this petition targeted at Reddit, Zynga, and Twitter. Only 1,500 people so far have signed the petition, but with the incredible popularity of the currency on reddit and a member list of 24,000 rich shibes (people) on the dogecoin specific subreddit [/r/dogecoin](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin), dogecoin could gain the traction needed to see itself listed with the biggest crypto currencies, [Bitcoin](http://bitcoin.org) and [Litecoin](https://litecoin.org).

Response to the peition has been very postive, even Reddit CEO Yishan Wong gave his [support](http://www.change.org/petitions/reddit-inc-accept-dogecoin-as-a-currency-on-reddit/responses/9786). Wong said Reddit could the currency if Dogecoin can get "a reliable payment processor (like [Coinbase](https://coinbase.com/?r=52b8ce62d79cb3f769000035&utm_campaign=user-referral&src=referral-link))." He even went so far as to endorse Dogecoin over Bitcoin:

<blockquote class="center-block twitter-tweet" lang="en" align="center"><p>I have converted the majority of my BTC holdings to Dogecoin, the cryptocurrency of the future. <a href="http://t.co/e4bFO1rtzz">http://t.co/e4bFO1rtzz</a></p>&mdash; Yishan Wong (@yishan) <a href="https://twitter.com/yishan/statuses/413746060163444736">December 19, 2013</a></blockquote>

Currently the only way to purchase Dogecoin is through arbitrage services, such as [Cryptsy](https://www.cryptsy.com/users/register?refid=93255), that grant trading of Bitcoins for other crypto-currencies. Other methods include directly purchasing from people selling DOGE such as on the subreddit [/r/dogemarket](https://www.reddit.com/r/dogemarket).
