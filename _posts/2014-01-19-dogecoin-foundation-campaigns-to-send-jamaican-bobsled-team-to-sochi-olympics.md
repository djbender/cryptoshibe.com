The official [Dogecoin Foundation](http://foundation.dogecoin.com) has begun collecting donations to help send the Jamaican Bobsled Team to the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. With a goal of ~40M Doge ($30,000 USD), the Dogecoin Foundation hopes to not only help send an underfunded team to the Olympics but to also get significant exposure in doing so through dogecoin donations.

From the official website:

*This is our chance to prove to the world the power of dogecoin and do something truly great for a national team with a inspirational legacy. Feel the rhythm, feel the ride, get on down, it's bobsled time!*

The last line is clearly referencing the 1993 classic *Cool Runnings* in which the 1988 Jamaican Bobsled 4-man team qualifies for the Winter Olympics in Calgary, Alberta, Canada with the help of John Candy in the role of their coach.

Watts has been [quoted](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/winter-olympics/10572373/Winter-Olympics-2014-Move-over-Usain-Bolt-Jamaicas-cool-runners-are-back-and-hope-to-qualify-for-Sochi-Games.html) referencing the flick: "Cool Runnings, the Second Generation."

## Funding

A purpose built website to help track Dogecoin donations is available at [dogesled.net](http://www.dogesled.net). The site explains the Jamaican team as "need[ing] help raising money to cover equipment and travel costs."

The story goes deeper than just needing money to cover travel expenses, the team has struggled through training as well. Watts [originally planned](http://www.cbssports.com/olympics/eye-on-olympics/24412045/jamaican-bobsled-team-has-sights-set-on-sochi) to train a four-man team but was forced to cut it to only two people due to funding concerns. He has even paid out of pocket to finance trips to the United States to train.

[Team Jamaica](http://www.jamaicaolympics.com/archives/7542) described the situation while quoting Watts as:

*The Jamaican team may have captured hearts around the world two decades ago, but today the team doesn’t have a “any sponsor whatsoever,” Watt says.*

[Team Jamaica](http://www.teamja.org)'s [twitter account](https://twitter.com/JamaicaOlympics) announced the qualification on January 18:
