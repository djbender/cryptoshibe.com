Dogecoin being no stranger to large fluctuations saw a 60% increase in value overnight. [Cryptsy](https://www.cryptsy.com/users/register?refid=93255) has the two month old currency currently trading at over 140 Satoshi/DOGE.

Many shibes over on the [/r/dogecoin subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin) are in a frenzy over speculation of the cause of the boom, with many [pointing fingers](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1vnqen/over_100_satoshis_hold/ceu4103) at a person known as "Wolong" attempting to [manipulate](http://imgur.com/a/rCwFh) the marketplace. Someone even [guessed](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1vnqen/over_100_satoshis_hold/ceu4fdt) that this would require approximately $2 million dollars. Other [shibes](http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1vnqen/over_100_satoshis_hold/ceu47wv) claim that this isn't possible due to the size of the market.

A Bubble now could cause another long trough, like after the last bubble in December, or this boom could see the beginnings of a greater expansion of Dogecoin.

Dogecoin is also currently seeing a 14 day high of over 430% growth.
